# Python-learning-documentation
This is a documentation of every project I have completed in python. Each python project will be documenting, and I will explain what I learnt with each project and other details.


__1. PythonLearning.py__

This was my first time trying to creat things in python. I started with trying to learn the basics of the language and then attempted to create a calculator. The first calculator does not work but this is when I learnt about turning strings into integers when trying to add them to make a calculation. I also learnt that you have to define functions for things such as addition or subtraction. I then went on to attempt a second calculator with these new skills in mind. This calculator also does not work but I learnt the basic concepts of while and try loops.

__2. PythonLearning2__

This was my second project which I decided to make a Higher-Lower number guessing game. During this project I learnt about how to do basic checks that an input is a number and how to use random numbers.

__3. RockPaperSissors.py__

This was my third project and I learnt to improve my logic flow and advanced my skills using while loops. I also continued to experiment with random numbers.

__4. CalculatorAttempt3.py__

This was my fourth project where I learnt to check for random numbers and the difference between an integer and a floating number and how to check an input for them and also convert them to eachother. I also learnt to define more advanced functions and how the try except errorvalue effectively. This calculator works.

__5. OOP.py__

this was my fith project where I learnt the basics of Object Oriented Programming. During this project I also advanced my programming abilitys.
